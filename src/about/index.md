My name is <strong>Frode Thorsen BÃ¸rseth</strong>, and I am a <strong>software developer</strong> with a <strong>master's in physics</strong>.

While I am originally from <strong>Haugesund</strong> on the west-coast of <strong>Norway</strong>, I am today located further north in beautiful <strong>Trondheim</strong>, whither I moved many winters ago to attend <strong>NTNU</strong> (the Norwegian University of Science and Technology), and where I work as a backend developer for <strong>Telenor Software Lab</strong>.

<strong>Languages, programming, maths, music, and dance.</strong> Even though their mediums and domains may be more or less disparate, they are all forms of <strong>expression and communication</strong>. As such, they are the topics that interest me most, and so they make up the contents of this blog.
