title: This is a test

...

If this post, being my first ever, seems like it is just a patchwork of disconnected pieces of text and visual elements, I can happily state that it has served its purpose. I had a handful of goals for what this website should be capable of presenting, and have used this document to test them all out. It is as good a first post as any I could have come up with deliberately.

The generating script, templates, and source files I've made are all [available at GitHub](https://github.com/frodetb/boerseth-dot-com).


## Layout

First of all, the site is as bloat-free and lightweight as I could make it, inspired by [MotherfuckingWebsite](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/), [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz), and a number of others that I've forgotten about by now. It is mostly just pure HTML and CSS, generated from Markdown code by [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) (more on that [below](#pandoc)). 

Keeping too strictly on the road to minimalism, however, can also make things more complicated rather than simpler. So I've decided to include at least one exception worth mentioning, namely a small bit of javascript used to render mathematical notation. That is, the site uses K<sup class="latex">A</sup>T<sub class="latex">E</sub>X to render L<sup class="latex">A</sup>T<sub class="latex">E</sub>X-code (this, too, will be touched on [later](#math)).

There is also a justifiable bit of CSS to pretty things up. I have aimed for the look of a classic L<sup class="latex">A</sup>T<sub class="latex">E</sub>X template, and am quite pleased with the result.


## Pandoc

I have tried to make the site as easy to maintain and update as possible, so that I'll actually use it. One thing that makes everything very streamlined is that the entire site is generated from simple Markdown files using pandoc.

At first when I heard about pandoc, I just began using it to convert generic Markdown into html-document fragments. These bits of generated html I sandwiched in the middle of a `header` and `footer` file, and thought that such a process was good enough. But then when I finally actually started reading pandoc's documentation, I found that the program in fact is capable of producing standalone documents, while still leaving plenty of room and options for customisation.

Almost all of what I want in the website can be generated by pandoc from a single command, simply by supplying appropriate options. From a folder hierarchy of markdown files located in the directory `mark/`, along with some template files in the directory `tmpl/`, this entire website is generated from the following lines of bash:

```bash
cp -r mark site
cp tmpl/{style.css,favicon.png} site/
for md_file in `find site -type f -name "*.md"`; do
    pandoc \
        -s \                      # standalone
        --katex \                 # needed for formatting math
        -T BÅ’RSETH \              # page title suffix
        -c /style.css \           # all css from this file
        -H tmpl/head.html \       # HTML-code of additional head content
        -B tmpl/banner.html \     # HTML-code of site banner
        -A tmpl/footer.html \     # HTML-code of site footer
        -i $md_file \             # the markdown-file to be converted
        -o ${md_file%.md}.html    # where to store output
done
find site -type f -name "*.md*" -delete
```

Some work needs to be done in the first few lines, copying the folder structure of `mark/` into the folder `site/` along with the files `style.css` and `favicon.png`, and at the end the MD-files that come along for the ride need to be removed, but most of the job is simply finding all the `.md` files in `site/` to convert, and letting pandoc do its job. 

## Math

With the `--katex` option supplied to pandoc, writing beautiful mathematics with familiar L<sup class="latex">A</sup>T<sub class="latex">E</sub>X-like syntax is a walk in the park. For instance, the following code pasted into a Markdown file

```latex
$$
  \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}
  \; = \;
  1 + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots
  \; = \;
  \frac{\pi^2}{6}
$$
$$
  \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \text{e}^{-x^2} \text{d}x = \sqrt{\pi}
$$
```

will result in equations generated by K<sup class="latex">A</sup>T<sub class="latex">E</sub>X as follows:

$$
\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}
\; = \;
1 + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots
\; = \;
\frac{\pi^2}{6}
$$
$$
\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \text{e}^{-x^2} \text{d}x = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

Nice.


## Code

As should be clear already, pandoc supports the inclusion of code snippets written in a variety of languages, and will provide syntax-highlighting out of the box when generating standalone documents. Already I've included bash and L<sup class="latex">A</sup>T<sub class="latex">E</sub>X, but here is yet another example in Python:

```python
def get_dragon_fractal_corner(n: int) -> int:
    if n:
        while not n % 2:
            n >>= 1
        n >>= 1
    return n % 2
```
