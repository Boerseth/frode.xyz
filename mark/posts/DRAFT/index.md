title: Proportionality bias doesn't feel right

I am disappointed by how most explorations of conspiracy theories seem to lean so hard on proportionality bias as the cause. Every time I hear a discussion on the topic, it is that bias that is laid out as the main factor leading some people into these theories and circles. 

Recently after looking for a source of this claim, I found a description of the experiment that supposedly supported this notion. From its results the researchers concluded that this bias was in fact a natural tendency in humans, exhibited independently of whether the test-subject had a history of subscribing to conspiracy theories or not. In other words, while the presence of the bias was demonstrated, it didn't account for why some people believe in these theories.

So what else might be the cause? I am myself in many ways quite a paranoid individual, and have sought out a number of conspiracy theories in the past. They have often had an alluring aspect that has been difficult to pin down, and I've wondered what it was. Many years ago I first heard about proportionality bias - that big events must have proportionally big causes, e.g. having been planned - and I tried to feel around in my head whether that was where my weak spot was. Was I really just looking for a reason, for meaning in a chaotic world? 

To me, this explanation never really fit. I could not identify this particular nervousness in myself, this specific perspective, as the leading cause for my attraction to conspiracy theories. I did realise that my subconscious by definition was outside of my own reach, and that I perhaps was vulnerable to this bias without even realising it. Still, I was disappointed with it as an explanation. 

But as I've come to realise, the explanation might in fact be far simpler. What causes most people to believe in conspiracy theories might simply be a fear of being misled. 

In my case, I think what made me vulnerable to conspiracy theories was being raised by a dishonest and untrustworthy parent, giving me a fear of being misled by all authority figures. This I think would explain a lot, since not all people believe such stories, while a proportionally small group do. The question might be how their relationship with authority figures was in their early years.
