I am a <strong>software developer</strong> with a <strong>master's in physics</strong>. Originally from <strong>Haugesund</strong> on the west-coast of <strong>Norway</strong>, I am today located further north in beautiful <strong>Trondheim</strong>, whither I moved many summers ago to attend <strong>NTNU</strong> (the Norwegian University of Science and Technology). Apart from a year abroad and vacations back home, this is where I have spent most of my adult life.

<strong>Languages, programming, maths, music, and dance.</strong> Even though their mediums and domains may be more or less disparate, they are all forms of <strong>expression and communication</strong>. They are the topics that interest me most, and for that reason they make up the contents of this blog.
